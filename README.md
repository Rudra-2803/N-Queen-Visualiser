Hereâ€™s a description you can use for your N-Queen Visualizer GitHub repository:

N-Queen Visualizer
A Python-based visualizer for solving the classic N-Queens problem, where N queens must be placed on an N x N chessboard without threatening each other. This project provides an interactive and graphical approach to demonstrate various algorithms for solving the N-Queens puzzle, such as backtracking.

Features

1. Visualizes the placement of queens on the chessboard.

2. Supports different board sizes (N).

3. Interactive step-by-step execution of algorithms.

4.Clean and user-friendly interface.

5. Adjustable speed for visualization.
